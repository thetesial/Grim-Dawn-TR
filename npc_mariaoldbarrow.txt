What brings you back to Homestead?
I've brought supplies from the Black Legion.
All this, for us? I don't know what to say.{^n}{^n}Thank you. I am shocked to hear that the Legion is willing to share their resources.
They did not need them as much as you.
It took some persuading, but they pulled through. (Lie)
Just passing through.
I'd like to thank you, on behalf of all of us here at Homestead, for all the hard work you've put into this community.{^n}{^n}The materials you've delivered will help us rebuild what we've lost.
You're welcome.
I'd like to thank you, on behalf of all of us here at Homestead, for all the hard work you've put into this community.
You're welcome.
It was brave of you to go out there. Dermapterans are vicious insects that will devour anything unfortunate enough to cross their path.
They weren't so tough.
I hope never to fight them again.
Douglass tells me that you're going out to the Thornsbury and Elmsworth farms. I hope you're as tough as you look. Dermapterans should not be trifled with.
They don't stand a chance against me.
I'll be careful.
Welcome to our home.
Who's in charge here?
Depends who you ask. The farm belongs to Douglass, but Captain Somer of the Black Legion insists that everything must go through her.{^n}{^n}If you ask me, she's too focused on the invaders and not enough on making sure we have enough to eat. We need those Dermapterans dealt with or else nobody's going to survive through the winter.
I can help with that.
That would be just wonderful. Please, speak to Douglass. He can fill you in on the details.
I will.

Good luck.
What can you tell me about Homestead?
Well, I've lived here nearly my entire life. Married Douglass when I was 14 and we've cultivated the land with two wonderful boys for decades.{^n}{^n}We've done everything we could to keep the community going after the Grim Dawn. Together we turned Homestead into a sanctuary that has withstood countless attacks. Some of our neighbors were too stubborn to leave their farms though. I'm afraid we haven't heard from them in weeks.{^n}{^n}I may not approve of the Black Legion or their methods, but I am not going to denounce the brave men and women that keep us safe at night.

Farewell.
Thank you.
