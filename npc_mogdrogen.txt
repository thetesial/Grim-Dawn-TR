Avatar of Mogdrogen
It seems that I have underestimated you, mortal. You are strong of body and spirit.{^n}{^n}That's good. You will need it in the trials ahead.
How are you alive?
You have merely slain my avatar, a physical manifestation of myself. Believe me, if you had faced my full manifestation, we would not be having this discussion.{^n}{^n}You cannot kill a god, mortal.
We'll see about that.
So this is just an illusion, interesting.
And don't you forget it.
Don't make that mistake again.
Has your rage cooled, mortal?{^n}{^n}Are you finished with your futile outbursts of violence?

I'm just getting started.
Farewell.
Have you come to pay your respects, mortal?

Farewell.
Come to pay your respects?
May I ask some questions?
Ask.
Who or what are you?
I am the Lord of Beasts, protector of nature, and guardian of the Rhowari.{^n}{^n}Your mortal kind calls me Mogdrogen.
What about the other gods? What about Empyrion?
Empyrion? I have not heard that name uttered in centuries.{^n}{^n}These Chosen that you associate with. I wonder if they truly understand what they have uncovered underneath those ruins.
I have another question.
Faith has guided Father Kymon.
The results of their fervor speak for themselves.
Perhaps they do not.
What about the other gods? What about Uroboruuk?
You would presume that this idol of the death worshippers stands among the gods?{^n}{^n}A laughable suggestion.{^n}{^n}This Uroboruuk is more myth than reality. How do you know he even exists?
I have another question.
I suppose I don't know for sure.
I found proof. Perhaps you do not know everything.
Guardian of the Rhowari?

I have another question.
I...see.
A god? Shouldn't you be protecting Cairn?
This is a mere fragment of my presence, an avatar; but more than enough to squash you like the insignificant insect you are.{^n}{^n}So be careful to presume what I should or should not be doing, mortal.
Then why allow the Grim Dawn to happen?
Nobody talks to me that way.
You would threaten an Ascendant? One who was old when Erulan was but a few tribesmen?{^n}{^n}Surely your mortal struggles have not brought you before me seeking your own destruction?
Alright then, I'll be going.
God or not, you die! (Misguidedly Attack)
I have another question.
Alright then, I'll be going.
My mistake.
If you are a god, then why did you allow the Grim Dawn to happen?
The wheels set in motion to culminate in what you call the Grim Dawn have been spinning for far longer than your short life.{^n}{^n}Even one such as I could not have foreseen the events that transpired that day.
But why allow the Aetherials and Chthonians to continue?
This world has become just another piece in their brutal conflict.{^n}{^n}To presume that the cycle could be disrupted is the futile wish of a doomed mortal.
But your people will die!
The fate of the Rhowari is for me to dispense.{^n}{^n}I do not expect a mortal to comprehend my intentions.


I have another question.
Some god you are...
I guess we will have to handle this ourselves.
So you will do nothing?
It is not for you to presume what I will or will not do, mortal.


I have another question.
Some god you are...
I guess we will have to handle this ourselves.

I have another question.
Hardly an answer.
Perhaps you are not as powerful as I thought.
This may be a mere fragment of my presence, an avatar. But it is more than enough to squash you like the insignificant insect you are.{^n}{^n}Watch your tone with me, mortal.

I have another question.
Alright then, I'll be going.
I apologize.
I have another question.
I see.
Were you mortal once?
An insulting question. Were you not a fool once?
I have another question.
Sorry I asked.
What is your relationship with the Rovers?
The Rhowari are my chosen people.{^n}{^n}It is through them that I shall act out my will in the coming darkness.
The coming darkness?
Be certain of this, mortal: the suffering of your people has only begun.
I have another question.
That's ominous...
Um, great.
How did you convince Rhowan to secede his throne in Arkovia?
An ancient tale, and one I enjoy retelling.{^n}{^n}However, I convinced him of nothing. I saw into his heart and revealed to him the truth he already knew.{^n}{^n}It was Rhowan who had the wisdom to accept my words as nothing less and for that his descendants have my blessing.
You mentioned a coming darkness?
I have another question.
Rhowan sounded like a wise ruler.
Fascinating.
I have another question.
I see.
Nevermind.
Farewell.
You have done the Rhowari a great justice this day, mortal. For this, I thank you.
Is this your shrine?
The shrine was created in my honor, yes. It is one of many, though none suffered the corrupting presence of Ch'thon as this one.{^n}{^n}Your valor shall not go without reward.

Thank you.
Have you come to pay your respects, mortal?
Who are you?
I am the Lord of Beasts, protector of nature, and guardian of the Rhowari.{^n}{^n}Your mortal kind calls me Mogdrogen.
A god? Shouldn't you be protecting Cairn?
A mere fragment of my presence, an avatar. But more than enough to squash you like the insignificant insect you are.{^n}{^n}So watch your tone with me, mortal.
Alright then, I'll be going.
I...see.
Farewell.
