Harmond
Sometimes, when I close my eyes, I still see her, you know.{^n}{^n}I can smell her auburn hair, feel her gentle hand upon my cheek.{^n}{^n}But then I open them again and all I see is this slith hole. This world is too cruel for an angel like Annabel. She would wither away in its corruption.
I'm sorry.
They took my Annabel from me. I'll make them pay yet!
I'll... leave you to your thoughts.
They took my Annabel from me. I'll make them pay yet!
I'll... leave you to your thoughts.
I can tell you've had yer share of horrors. Tell me, what was the battle like?
It was gruesome and bloody. Just the way I like it.
I hope they suffered. Nobody deserves to be torn apart by monsters like that, and now there are a few less in the world. Thanks to you. {^n}{^n}Here, take yer iron.
Thank you. I did what had to be done.
They were a horrifying sight. I ended it quickly.
Less guts in ya than I reckoned, but at least they're still inside ya and not spilling out on some road, eh? {^n}{^n}Anyway, here's yer iron.
Thank you.
It was sad to see men twisted in such a way. I took them out of their misery.
Perhaps they didn' deserve the fate they got, but at least now there's less of them out there threatenin' the living. {^n}{^n}You did the right thing. Here's yer iron.
Thank you.
You're not going to convince me that you've killed the mutants without some personal experience to back it up!
Where should I look for them?
Balros and Hagra chased the survivors from Burrwitch as far as the Moldering Fields, just beyond the Burrwitch Outskirts. Start yer hunt there.
I'll get on it.
I'll get on it.
Ya killed scores of the shamblin' Dead, but I think ya can do better. The Aether corruption created some truly monstrous mutations in the Dead. I heard tale from the Burrwitch survivors that witnessed a horrifying transformation with their own eyes.{^n}{^n}Balros and Hagra, they was fine folk, ran the boarding house up in Burrwitch. That is until the Aether got them. Turned them into things ya used to only see in nightmares. Those that got away spoke of bloated flesh and blades of bone. I cannot even imagine it.{^n}{^n}Word is, they chased the survivors as far as the Moldering Fields, to the south of Burrwitch. Go out there and hunt some down. Then tell me of the slaughter; I'll make it worth yer while.
Alright.
I think I'm done here.
I have already dealt with them.
Then tell me, what was the battle like?



There is a fire in yer eyes and blood on yer clothes. Did ya put those tainted men down?{^n}{^n}Tell me, how did it feel?
I felt vindicated. Righteous.
That's what I like to hear! If it wasn' for my bum leg, I'd be out there with ya. Payin' others with good iron and hearin' the tales is just the next best thing. {^n}{^n}Speakin' of which, here's yer share.
Thank you.

I didn't feel much of anything.
Then you and I have somethin' in common. After those things took my Annabel from me, I don' feel much of anythin' either. {^n}{^n}Here, take yer coin. You've earned it.
Thank you.

Regret... these people once lived.
I ain' payin' for a lecture in conscience. Those things are abominations. Abominations that killed my wife, Annabel, and turned me into a cripple! {^n}{^n}The only way I can get back at them now is by payin' someone like you. So if ya want more iron, skip the morals and kill some more Dead. {^n}{^n}Here's yer pay.
Thank you.

Yer blade looks a bit dry there, stranger. Come back to me when you've put the dead where they belong. I want to hear all the details.
Where should I look for them?
Look for Farros, Jillius and Neegan out in Wightmire. Check all the sunken homes, search through the camps. Don' come back without their blood on yer clothes.
I'll be back.
I'll be back.
I hear you've been cleanin' up out there in Lower Crossing. If you're goin' to keep fighting those bastards, you'll need better equipment than that. {^n}{^n}Here's somethin' you'll likely never see again in this world, stranger. Somethin' for nothin'. Take some iron coin off my hands; I don't need it no more.
Why are you helping me?
Y'see, they killed my Annabel back when the village was first overrun. Ain' nothin' gonna bring her back; and if it tries, I'll put a bullet through its skull.{^n}{^n}I got nothin' left but revenge, so I pay good iron to those willin' to put down those abominations.{^n}{^n}Take Farros, Jillius and Neegan, for instance. Used to all be good men, defenders of the empire; now nothin' more than shamblin' fiends stalking the swamplands of Wightmire.{^n}{^n}Slaughter them. Put them in the dirt like they ought to be and I'll give ya some more iron from my stash.
I'll put them down.
I don't trust handouts.
I have already taken care of them.
That's what I like to hear.{^n}{^n}Tell me, how did it feel?



Oh look, it's the possessed one. Tell ya what, I've got somethin' that needs doing and I'll pay good to see it done.{^n}{^n}I'm not quite sure you've got what it takes but come back with some blood on yer boots and maybe I'll reconsider. Just try to make sure it's not yer own blood...
Alright then.
