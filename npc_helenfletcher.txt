*Helen stares forward silently*
Alright then.
You poor stupid thing. Gotta say, you're making me feel a little guilty. It's all a sham, hon. You got swindled. We do what we gotta do out here, and it sure beats aiming a gun at every traveler that crosses us.{^n}{^n}Now get going before you give away our little scheme.
You don't have to live like this. (Tell her about the prison)
A safe place? I forget what that even means. And you'd really take us in, even after what we pulled?
You did what you had to. You deserve a second chance.
I...I don't know what to say. I...thank you.
See you in Devil's Crossing. (Open Riftgate)
You deceitful wench. You're both as good as dead!
Curse my big mouth. Guess it's your money and your life, hon.
Time to die, thief!
Please do something! He's going to kill me!
I'll handle this.
What do I care?
