Devil's Crossing
Something For Nothing
Kill Zombies
Harmond is a wreck of a man, hollow of emotions but for the cold rage he feels towards the corpses now roaming Lower Crossing and beyond. {^n}{^n}In the hopes that you will go out there and put down the fallen soldiers Farros, Jillius and Neegan, who are still roaming around Wightmire, he has given you enough Iron Coins to buy some supplies. {^n}{^n}This is probably the only handout you will ever see in this grim new world.



Slay Farros, the Rotted
Slay Jillius, the Decayed
Slay Neegan, the Withered

Return to Harmond
You have slain the three rotted soldiers Harmond spoke of. Perhaps now he can move on.{^n}{^n}Return to him in Devil's Crossing.
Return to Harmond
