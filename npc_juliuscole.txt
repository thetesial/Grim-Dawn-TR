What's it to ya? Move along!
Very well...
You still wandering about? Get moving before I change my mind.
Fine.
Hold on there, traveler. You wouldn't want this pretty lady's brains to spill all over the ground, would ya? Let's see some iron.
Let's not do anything rash. (Give 300 Iron Bits)
Thank you kindly. You go on your merry way now.
Get out of my sight.
I don't think so! (Attack)
As if I care about some random person on the road. Die! (Attack)
I'm turning around. No need to make a mess.
