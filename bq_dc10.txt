Bounty: Igor
Bounty
Igor "The Brawler" was a brutal man with more muscle than brains back before the Grim Dawn.{^n}{^n}Now rumor is that he's accepted Cronley's Aether crystals to become even stronger. If such a beast of a man ever decides to attack Devil's Crossing, he could cause some serious harm.{^n}{^n}Anyone that tracks down the Brawler in Cronley's Hideout and puts him down will be justly rewarded with some of our scavenged materials.
