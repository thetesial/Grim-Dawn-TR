Aether Cluster
The crystal hums with aetherial energy.
(Back away)
This cluster of Aether crystal appears to be the source of the corruption. Its destruction would see an end to Cronley's mad designs.{^n}{^n}You hear faint whispers in your head as you approach it, as if a multitude of voices were calling out to you from within the shard.
Destroy the laboratory and the crystal.
Destroy the laboratory and keep some of the crystal for yourself.
Leave the crystal alone.
