Well, I'm a bit poorer, but I suppose I'm still breathing. Thank you for the timely rescue.
And don't you forget it.
Thanks for saving my behind back there. Turns out not all the rifts mean bad business. {^n}{^n}I've gone ahead and set up shop. Let me know if you need anything.
Thanks.
Not the coziest of establishments, but beats being stuck out in that swamp any day.
That it does.
