The Chthonic Menace
A Forgotten Evil
Black Legion Fort
The Cult of Ch'thon is planning to resurrect an ancient evil buried underneath the Necropolis. With the way north reopened, Inquisitor Creed and Ulgrim are setting out immediately to reconvene with the Legion forces at Fort Ikon. You are to meet them there. Fort Ikon is to the north, through the Darkvale Gate and past the Asterkarn Mountains.
