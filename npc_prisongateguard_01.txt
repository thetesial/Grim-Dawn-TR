Rook
Go right in, friend. Thanks to you, I get to eat tonight.
Take care.
Welcome back, friend.
Thank you.
Welcome back to Devil's Crossing. I'll let you through.
Thank you.
The Captain said you are good to go. Don't start any trouble.
Thank you.
I've heard about what you're doing for us, risking your life out there.{^n}{^n}You've more than earned your keep. Please, come inside and rest a while.
Thank you.
Sorry, but I can't let you enter. You'll need to be cleared by the Captain before I let you through.
I'll speak to the Captain then.
