The Trials of Homestead
Reaping What You Sow
Kill Cultist Leader
Captain Somer is determined to reconnect her forces with the bulk of the Legion to the north. Her scouts have uncovered the identity of the cult's leader in the region, one by the name Karroz, the Sigil of Ch'thon. He has entrenched himself at the Darkvale Gate, far north of Sorrow's Bastion. The captain wishes him assassinated so that the cultist chain of command is crippled and the Legion can advance on their position.
Slay Karroz, Sigil of Ch'thon
