There are many layers to the forsaken void, filled with ashes and misery, but one such place houses a fiend known as Bane'Gargoth. From within its Obsidian Throne, this void spawn sends forth his armies to spread havoc and suffering upon Cairn. Prove your worth to Father Kymon. Enter the void through a rift at the Plains of Strife to the north of Fort Ikon. Brave the Forsaken Wastes and enter the Obsidian Throne. Destroy Bane'Gargoth.
